KEGG-decoder-carbonfixation
================================================================
### Description ###
This is a fork of Ben Tullys (https://bjtully.github.io/) tool Kegg-Decoder version 1.2.1. I stripped away everything but the carbon fixation pathways and extended those heavily. I added many gene orthologs and pathway variants that are described in various microorganisms (as of ~ august 2021) and designed a new scoring system that takes into account both pathway completeness and the presence/absence of what I regard as key enzymes for the pathways. I added new output flags that produce heatmaps with only one pathway, a pathway overview or a detailed view that displays the enzymes that contribute to the pathway complentess (accessible through KEGG-decoder --help). I also added a new colour scheme to the heatmap output: blue: complete (sub-)pathway / enzyme present; shades of green: key enzymes present, pathway completeness; shades of red: key enzymes missing, pathway completeness.
